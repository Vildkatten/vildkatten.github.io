		<h1>Obsessed by Two</h1>
     <p>I’m obsessed by the number two.</p>
     <p>If you wonder why I’m always wearing layers,<br />
     	it’s because I have to get dressed twice.
     </p>
     <p>My weight goes up and down,<br />
     	as I either take two bites<br />
     	or have two portions.
     </p>
     <p>It’s the same with drink:<br />
     	two sips or two pints<br />
     	two glasses or two bottles.
     </p>
     <p>I’ve got two houses:<br />
     	one for parties<br />
     	and one for quiet nights in.<br />
     	And if the toilet is blocked<br />
     	(because of a number two),<br />
     	I can use the loo next door.
     </p>
     <p>My two jobs keep me busy:<br />
     	I write novels for pleasure<br />
     	and perform poetry for pain.<br />
     	Neither pays my bills.
     </p>
     <p>Two friends are always by my side:<br />
     	one agrees with everything I say,<br />
     	the other tells me what I need to hear.
     </p>
     <p>I’ve got two partners:<br />
     	A man for love<br />
     	and a woman for sex.<br />
     	They argued for two days,<br />
     	when they found out I was two-timing them.<br />
     	Now I’m having a double wedding<br />
     	on the second of the second.
     </p>
     <p>Two parents, two siblings, two pets,<br />
     	although one is a cat and one is a dog.<br />
     	It messes with my brain a bit,
     </p>
     <p>but not as much as the fact<br />
     	that there’s only one of me<br />
     	and I’ve only got one life.
