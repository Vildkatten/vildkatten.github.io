          <h1>Privacy policy</h1>
            <p>Your privacy is important to us. To better protect your privacy we provide this notice explaining our online information practices and the choices you can make about the way your information is collected and used.</p>

        <h2>Information we collect</h2>

            <p>Poetry Slammers occasionally needs to collect information for convenience, practicality, or technical requirements. This information includes:</p>

                <li>
            The type of device running the application (e.g. an iPad), its platform version (e.g. iOS 5.0), and the version of Poetry Slammers in use (e.g. 1.0).
                </li>
                <li>
            Your current subscription status and basic information, not including credit-card numbers or other payment details.

            <p>Information supplied to Poetry Slammers by Apple, which may include your name, email address, and ZIP code if you opted into the collection of this information upon subscribing.
            Like most websites, Poetry Slammers also collects and stores information automatically and through the use of electronic tools that may be transparent to visitors. For example, we may log the name of your Internet Service Provider, your IP address, and information provided by and about your Internet browser. As we adopt additional technology, we may also gather similar information through other means.</p>

            <h2>How we use information</h2>

            <p>We only use information you provide to operate Poetry Slammers and its various features.</p>

            <p>We do not share this information with outside parties except to the extent necessary to accomplish Poetry Slammers’s functionality.</p>

            <p>We use return email addresses to answer the email we receive. Such addresses are not used for any other purpose and are not shared with outside parties.</p>

            <p>We use non-identifying and aggregate information to better design Poetry Slammers. For instance, we may make feature decisions based on the percentage of our readership using a certain device or operating system.</p>

            <p>We may disclose your information in response to subpoenas, court orders, or other legal process, or to establish or exercise our legal rights or to defend against legal claims.</p>

            <p>We may disclose your information when we believe it necessary or desirable in order to investigate, prevent, or take action regarding illegal activities, suspected fraud, situations involving potential threats to the physical safety of any person, violations of our policies, and/or to protect our rights and property.</p>

            <h2>External services</h2>

            <p>External services beyond Poetry Slammers’s control are integrated with Poetry Slammers where necessary, such as Google Analytics for traffic measurement and tracking. Poetry Slammers makes reasonable efforts to ensure that all integrated external services are trustworthy and reputable, but we cannot be held responsible for data collection and usage by such services.</p>

            <h2>Data security</h2>

            <p>To prevent unauthorized access, maintain data accuracy, and ensure the correct use of information, we have put in place appropriate physical, electronic, and managerial procedures to safeguard and secure the information we collect online.</p>

            <h2>Children’s privacy</h2>

            <p>Protecting the privacy of the very young is especially important. For that reason, we never collect or maintain information at our website from those we actually know are under 13, and no part of our website is structured to attract anyone under 13.</p>

            <h2>How to contact us</h2>

            <p>Should you have other questions or concerns about these privacy policies, or to have any of your personally identifiable information deleted, please email <a href="mailto:poetryslammers@gmail.com?subject=Privacy%20Policy%20request">poetryslammers@gmail.com</a> with the details of your request.</p>

            <p>Due to the nature of backups and logs, deleted data may persist in backups and logs until they are deleted.</p>
